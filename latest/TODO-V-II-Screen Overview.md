This comprehensive list of screens provides a solid foundation for this Fashion Shop Stock Management System (V-Stox). Each screen is designed with specific functionalities and features that cater to different aspects of stock management. The components listed for each screen are based on the reusable components we created earlier, which will help maintain consistency throughout the app.
Here are some key points to consider as you start developing these screens:

Navigation: Implement a navigation system that allows easy movement between these screens. The bottom tab navigation we discussed earlier would work well for the main sections (Home, Inventory, Sales, Reports, Settings), with stack navigation for sub-screens within each section.
State Management: As you develop these screens, consider implementing a state management solution like Context API or Redux to handle data flow between screens efficiently.
API Integration: While the current plan uses local storage, keep in mind the potential need for API integration in the future. Design your data handling functions with this in mind.
Performance: For screens that might handle large amounts of data (like Inventory or Sales), implement pagination or virtualized lists to ensure smooth performance.
User Experience: Pay special attention to the user flow between screens. For example, after adding a new product, the user should be redirected back to the Inventory screen with some confirmation of the successful addition.
Offline Functionality: Since you're using local storage, ensure that all functionalities work offline and sync with Google Drive when online.
Customization: Allow for easy customization of components and screens to adapt to different types of fashion shops (e.g., clothing, accessories, footwear).
